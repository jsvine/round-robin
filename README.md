Round Robin
===========

Mike was a strikingly round robin. Always the early bird, never one to miss a meal; but also a "late bird," caught oftentimes sneaking into the Canopy Club's pantry for a midnight snack.  Caught because his rotund nature often left his head stuck in his favorite wormhole (third shelf on the left).

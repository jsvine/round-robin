This Git repository is an experiment in collaborative storytelling, a riff on the traditional [round robin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_story) technique.

How To Participate
==================

Step 1: Fork this repository.

Step 2: Add a sentence or paragraph to the end of the story (README.md).

Step 3: Submit a pull request.

I'm aiming to incorporate as many pull requests as possible, but reserve the right to reject some, especially if they contain hate speech, et cetera.

Miscellany
==========

I've started a [similar experiment at Branch.com](http://branch.com/b/round-robin) to see how the two versions diverge. The two communities share certain features:

- They both focus on collaboration.

- They both enable "forking" (or, in Branch's nomenclature, "branching").

But they differ in important ways, too:

- The barrier to entry is, I'd argue, lower on Branch than on GitHub.

- Identities are more clearly attached to contributions on Branch than on GitHub.

- Contributions on GitHub don't enter the master story until I approve a pull request. Contributions on Branch appear immediately.

- GitHub allows for retroactive editing (and even total reorganization); Branch doesn't allow any editing.

I'm sure there are some differences I've missed. If so, let me know via a pull request.
